**A React app that provides an interactive way of building a burger**

# Description:
A demo react app that I followed along with on the Udemy course "React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)" by Maximilian Schwarzmuller. It allows the user to interactively add ingredients to a burger and view the resulting burger. The App was initially implemented using class-based components. However, this branch implements the App using functional components with hooks. 

The App can be visited on: https://react-my-burger-fc740.web.app/
